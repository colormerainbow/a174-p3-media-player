            <h2>Transcipt of Video "The Benefits of Protein on Weight Management"</h2>
            <div class="transcript-text">

                <p>
                    Hi!

                    I'm Kathy from Katalyst Fitness and
                    Nutrition, and today I wanted to talk to
                    you
                    about protein and why it's so beneficial
                    for weight loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So,
                    when you're trying to lose weight,
                    protein is the key to getting you
                    to your goal. Research shows that most
                    women
                    may eat too little protein and the
                    benefits of a higher daily protein
                    intake include
                    weight loss, increased metabolism,
                    preserving your muscle
                    as we age, and then maintaining a lean
                    fat burning physique, which is what we're
                    after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, proteins are made up of amino acids
                    and
                    these amino acids are needed for your
                    muscles, for your blood,
                    skin, hair, nails, and your internal organs.
                    Your body produces some of these amino
                    acids, but
                    you must get the others known as the
                    essential amino acids through your diet.
                    So for the most part, eating animal
                    protein like meat,
                    fish, eggs, or dairy every day will
                    provide all the essential amino acids
                    that you need in the proper balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So to lose weight,
                    you need to consume fewer calories than
                    you burn, and eating protein
                    can increase the number of calories that
                    you burn by increasing your metabolic
                    rate -
                    that's your calories out and then
                    reducing your appetite, which are your
                    calories in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is due to the thermic effect of
                    food.
                    It actually takes more energy to process
                    and digest
                    protein than it does to process carbs or
                    fats, and that's going to lead to you
                    burning as much as 80 to 100 calories a
                    day just by eating protein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the biggest benefit of protein for
                    weight loss is the satiety factor.
                    So you're going to feel full longer and
                    reduce your appetite, which again
                    leads to a reduction in your overall
                    calories. So eating more protein
                    makes it way easier to stick to any
                    weight loss diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there was a study that showed women
                    over 12 weeks who increased their
                    protein intake
                    to 30 percent of their total calories,
                    ate 441 fewer calories per day
                    and lost 11 pounds over that 12 weeks,
                    just by eating more protein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how much protein do you need? For
                    weight loss, a protein intake at around
                    30 percent of your calories
                    seems to be ideal, due to the increase in
                    the metabolic rate that we discussed
                    and the decrease in hunger and the
                    reduction of overall calories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So most studies suggest that 0.7
                    to 1 gram per pound of body weight is
                    sufficient. The more active that you are,
                    the more protein that you would need.
                    So, if your job is physically demanding,
                    or you do any sort of regular exercise,
                    you're going to need to eat more protein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So fueling your body properly with
                    protein is going to get you your best
                    results for weight loss
                    while maintaining muscle and increasing
                    your metabolism.
